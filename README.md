MG-GY 6343-INET (6343) Human Capital Engineering  Analytics, Online
Fall 2023
Course Pre-requisites: Graduate Standing 
Course Description:
This course examines and applies the valuation and management of intangible assets in designing and managing post-industrial organizations.  As organizations increasingly rely on technology to produce value, these technological solutions require interactions with other forms of value creation like Human Capital Management, Intellectual Property development and Organization Culture.   The first part of the course focuses on human capital engineering using an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on diverse fields including industrial-organizational psychology, industrial engineering, economics, and artificial intelligence to create a holistic view of how work in its various forms creates value. The second part of the course addresses people analytics, providing the student with a knowledge and understanding of current best practices, issues, and decision points in building an effective human capital analytic program.  This part of the course will also focus on data structure and design to enable automation and predictive modeling and will place an emphasis on technology-enabled reporting.
Course Objective:
By the end of the course, students should:
· Understanding of how to apply Human Capital Theory to HR Management, Industrial Engineering, and related fields to building a Human Capital Strategy
· Understand the types of HC/HR data that exist and analytic options that are commonly used.
· Understand how the interplay between human competencies and the capabilities of technology combine to accomplish work and create value.
· Demonstrate how analytics are applied to human capital and used to make decisions.
· Identify standard Key Performance Indicators often used in HR scorecards and measurement.
· Identify and create data displays and dashboard designs that enable organization decision making and change.
· Develop a working knowledge in the area through focused projects, presentations, and individual assignments.
Course Structure:
Since the first part of this course investigates new and cutting-edge theories and their application, it will be structured more as a research tutorial to facilitate individual student’s exploration.  Lectures and on-line experiences will be used to build an understanding of the topic and a basic toolkit for strategic analysis and human capital management.  These tools (e.g., Strategy Map, Competency Model, HR Scorecard) will be applied to a case of the student’s own choosing and form. the basis of a Human Capital Strategy which will become the basis for the Analytics part of the course.
The second part of the course will develop students’ hands-on skills in human capital analytics. Building on the first half of the course, students will receive instructions and templates for designing a Human Capital scorecard (KPI’s), a data structure and a HC dashboard.  Each student will be expected to deliver an oral and visual presentation of a data dashboard in addition to a detailed final paper tying together all the deliverables in the course.
Most of the course content will be delivered through Brightspace but student teams will be given an opportunity to interact with the instructor through regularly scheduled synchronous Zoom video-conference sessions.
